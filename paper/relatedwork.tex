\section{Related Work}
Much of the inspiration for stream processing systems can be trace back to data stream management systems. These systems support a window based query language. Most of these languages are derived from SQL, for instance STREAM\cite{arasu2004stream} defines a language called \textit{Continuous Query Language(CQL)} which has similar syntactic characteristics as SQL. Aurora\cite{abadi2003aurora}, STREAM\cite{arasu2004stream} and Nile\cite{hammad2004nile} are some of the prominent implementations of DSMSs. Complex event processing(CEP) systems such as Esper\cite{esper}, Siddhi\cite{suhothayan2011siddhi}, Cayuga\cite{brenna2007cayuga} also share many characteristics with DSMSs except for their use cases. CEP systems are capable of handling multiple incoming event streams(which are similar to the input streams) and identifying patterns across streams which are of interest to the end users. However these systems does not support user defined logic and hence not suitable for implement complex logic based on machine learning techniques.
